# InventoryManagementSystem

This was my first larger Java project. It allows for adding, updating, and removing parts 
and products from a warehouse inventory system as well as associating parts with products.
I also developed a crude save method to save the data by writing it in a specific format to a file on the users system.
This data is automatically loaded back into the system when the user launches the application.
Currently struggling to make this an executable where double click launches the program.
